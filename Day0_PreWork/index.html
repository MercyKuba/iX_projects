            <p> About me </p>
            <p>
                I am originally from Kyrgyzstan. In 2017, I came to the US as an international student. I study 
                at University of Houston, soon to be graduate in December 2022.
                I was trying myself in different industries starting from transport logistics, market analytics, 
                entertainment, and etc. However, through my life experience I realized that in order to fulfill 
                my mission in life, first I need to become a top-qualified professional at least in one area. I 
                chose CS because it has always been a challenge for me to discipline myself with tech(hard time 
                sittiong for hours in one place lol).
                Also, STEM is a good way to legally stay in America.
            <p></p>
                I do workout, travel, play League(not a lot recently), and enjoy Korean gangsta movies.
            <p></p>
                Not gonna lie - I have a lot of expectations from this internship, 
                but I am also dedicated to spend as much time as needed. So, do not hesitate to give me a lot ofl necessary 
                challenges and pressure :)
                Looking forward to work and learn with yall!
